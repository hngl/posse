# The _Posse_ App

_Posse_ is a cross-plaform mobile app demonstrating techniques for making apps for _Android_ and _iOS_.

## Gather your posse!

The app let's you compile a list of able-bodied men. When the need arises, you can select the members who will join your posse.

Underneath it's rough-and-tumble look, this is a common use case. Many applications are about create lists of items, and taking action on the items.

## What's in the box?

This app serves to demonstrate several interesting and new techniques for creating mobile apps.

- Xamarin, a cross-platform native mobile app develop platform based on _C#_
- Xamarin.Forms, Xamarin's cross-platform UI framework
- XAML, a declarative approach to code
- local data persistence through SQLite
- the Model-View-ViewModel architecture, which is a common design for mobile app code
